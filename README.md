# My fzf (TUI File Explorer)

A terminal-based file explorer and fuzzy finder written in **Rust**, built with **Ratatui**. 
Unlike standard `fzf`, this tool focuses on file navigation and previewing. It features a split-pane interface with real-time filtering, syntax-highlighted previews, and Vim-style navigation.
